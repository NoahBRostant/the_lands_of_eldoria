# Chapter One - The Day of Accord
###### Work In Progress
---

Thalos—the capital city of the Korvus Confederacy—was a marvel of stone and steel, a sprawling metropolis that rose like a crown from the heart of the confederation. Its streets were paved with smooth cobblestones, worn by centuries of footsteps, and its architecture was a seamless blend of ancient craftsmanship and modern ingenuity. Towering spires pierced the sky, their banners fluttering in the breeze, while intricate carvings adorned every archway and bridge. The city hummed with life, its people bustling about in preparation for the Day of Accord—a celebration marking 150 years of unity under the confederation’s banner.

It's hard to think of the war as ancient history, a tall tale told by passionate patrons at the local taverns or parents whose fathers' fathers were caught in battle. But the stone on some of the buildings around the city still showed remnants of its past. Much of Thalos was new or re-imagined since then; however, some old buildings still stood, such as the repurposed barracks, which was now home to a market district—A well-designed plan to show the peace and neutrality they now found themselves in.

Theigon walked through the crowded streets with practised ease, his movements fluid as he slipped between merchants hawking their wares and children darting about with ribbons streaming from their hands. His hood was pulled low, shadowing his sharp features, but even in anonymity, he carried himself with an air of quiet confidence. He was a nomad by nature, a rogue by trade, and Thalos was merely just another city on his endless journey. Yet unlike most days, the city seemed alive in a way he hadn’t seen before. A frenzy of excitement mostly aimed at the day off work for most of the working class—a holiday provided by the king owing to the celebration.

The scent of roasted meats and spiced ales wafted through the air as street performers danced and juggled to the cheers of onlookers. Musicians played lively tunes on flutes and drums, their melodies weaving through the din of conversation and laughter. Stalls lined the streets, selling everything from delicate jewellery to steaming bowls of stew. Theigon paused at one such stall, purchasing a gorgeously cooked skewer of grilled venison dipped in a rich sweet sauce before continuing towards the Sea Serpent Tavern—a Place he frequented often due to its good ale and pleasant company.

As he walked, the sounds of the city enveloped him: the clang of hammer on anvil from a nearby blacksmith, the chatter of haggling merchants, and the distant rumble of drums from a group of performers. The air was thick with the smell of roasting meats and freshly baked bread. The warm summer breeze carrying the delightful smell throughout the city.

Nestled in a narrow alley just off the main square, the Sea Serpent Tavern was a haven for those who preferred their celebrations with a touch of chaos… Its sign—a painted serpent coiled around an anchor—swayed gently in the breeze above the entrance. Theigon pushed open the heavy wooden door and stepped inside, greeted by the familiar din of laughter, shouting, and clinking tankards. The waft of cool air vented from the room as he shut the door behind him.

The tavern was dimly lit, its walls lined with shelves holding mismatched bottles of liquor. A massive hearth dominated one corner, its flames casting flickering shadows across the room with bannisters and brackets lining the right, holding a promenade aloft. The space was low at the edges of the room with cosy places to sit tucked away at the recesses of the room. And at the centre toward the bar, the ceiling gave way to a heightened ceiling. Ropes and pulleys filled the space above—a quaint and purposeful decoration. As Theigon made his way through the space, he ventured a glance around the room. The usual patrons were here, along with plenty of new faces. They were an eclectic mix: sailors fresh off their ships, mercenaries boasting about their exploits, and locals seeking refuge from the crowded streets outside. Theigon made his way to his usual corner table near the back, nodding to Old Marwen—the barkeep—as he passed.

“Back again?” Marwen asked gruffly, wiping down a tankard with a rag that had seen better days.
“Am I the only company you keep? — I’m not arguing, you're a nice enough lad,” a grin beginning to curl up the side of his rough-hewn face. He was a burly man, clearly having seen time on rough seas in his younger years. Theigon gave him a pondering look.

“Wouldn’t miss it,” Theigon replied with a smirk. He tossed a few coins onto the counter. “Ale.”

Marwen grunted in acknowledgement and slid a frothy tankard across to him. Theigon took it without ceremony and sank into his chair, letting the noise of the tavern wash over him like an old song. The ale was rich and smooth, with a hint of sweetness that complemented the savoury flavours of the venison he had eaten earlier.

“You still working for that Lord?” whispered Marwin leaning in close enough to be heard over the hustle and bustle of the tavern. Theigon glared at a pair of rowdy drunkards stumbling across the floor towards a red-haired elf—she looked capable, perhaps a sellsword?

“Not anymore,” Theigon poised a look towards Marwin. His rough features were dark despite the warm glow of the lamp beside us. “It won't be long till I move on. I have some business to attend to in Arkon; some noble no doubt wanting a debt settled or a head dislodged” he paused looking back to the elf to note her drinking a tall dark liquor before shoving the last remaining drunkard to the floor. And stepping over and away. “And the Lord I worked for was Halford,”.

“Don't go getting soft for the lord,” he said raising a brow.

As he sipped his ale, Theigon couldn't help but think about the rumours circulating in the city. There were whispers of new trade deals with the Isles of the Blessed, a distant land known for its exotic spices and magical artefacts. It was said that King Alden had been instrumental in brokering these agreements, which could bring unprecedented prosperity to the Korvus Confederacy. Theigon wasn't one for politics, but even he couldn't deny the excitement that filled the air.

Outside, the festivities reached their peak as twilight descended upon Korvus. Lanterns were lit along every street and square, their warm glow casting an amber hue over the city. The grand plaza at the centre of Thalos became a stage for performers—dancers twirled in elaborate costumes while fire-breathers sent plumes of flame into the night sky. Crowds gathered to watch as storytellers recounted tales of heroism from the Confederacy’s past: battles fought against rival provinces during the civil war and alliances forged by Queen Elara—the woman with ivory hair who had united them all.

Theigon finished his ale, placing it on the counter and giving his farewell to Marwen before stepping outside to join the throng heading toward the royal palace. He wasn’t particularly interested in speeches or ceremonies, or even royalty for that matter, but there was something about King Alden that intrigued him. The king was known for his wisdom and fairness—a rarity among rulers—and today’s address promised to be one for history books.

As Theigon walked, he felt a sense of hope that he hadn’t experienced in a long time. Maybe, just maybe, this king could lead them into an era of peace not just for Korvus, but perhaps for all of Eldoria. The thought was fleeting, but it was enough to make him pause and listen to the king’s words with a newfound sense of curiosity.

The palace balcony overlooked the grand plaza, its marble columns gleaming in the lantern light. King Alden stood tall before his people, dressed in robes of crimson and gold that matched the banners hanging above him. His voice carried across the plaza as he spoke of unity and hope—of how far they had come since Queen Elara’s time and how much further they could go together.

Theigon listened from within the crowd, leaning against a lamppost with his arms crossed. He couldn’t deny that Alden had a way with words. For a moment—just a moment—he allowed himself to believe that perhaps this king truly could lead them into an era of peace. The crowd around him seemed to share his sentiment, their faces lit with hope and anticipation.

But peace—is fragile…

It happened so quickly that many didn’t even realise what had occurred until it was too late.

A flash of dark red caught the light as a crimson dagger flashed across the square, its blade seeming to shimmer with an unnatural energy. Its speed never diminished till it struck its target. Theigon’s eyes snapped upward just as the dagger sunk into King Alden’s chest just above his heart. Time seemed to slow as blood blossomed across his robes like spilt ink on parchment, his eyes wide in horror. The rasp emanated from his body as the air around it seemed to darken as if death itself had been unleashed upon the balcony.

Gasps turned to screams as panic rippled through the crowd.

The king’s body slumped forward face sunken, now a rotting corpse with sunken eyes and paper skin.

A figure cloaked in black darted away from one of the nearby rooftops—a shadow moving against shadows—and Theigon’s instincts took over before he even realized he was on the move. Shoving through panicked citizens, his eyes locked on his target as he sprinted toward an alleyway where he’d seen them disappear.

“Move!” he barked at those blocking his path. People seemed more than eager to dart out of his way. Diving for cover or just pain running in whatever direction got them out from the square the quickest.

The assassin was fast—unnaturally so—but Theigon had spent years honing his skills as a tracker and hunter. He followed without hesitation into darker streets where lanterns burned dimly.

Theigon’s boots pounded against stone as he pursued his prey through twisting alleyways and abandoned marketplaces. He caught glimpses of them ahead—a flash of black fabric disappearing around corners—but they never stayed visible for long. And as the gradual darkness of night loomed, it became increasingly difficult to see.

His heart raced not just from exertion but from questions gnawing at his mind: Who would dare kill King Alden? And why? What did it mean for Korvus—and him? The thought sent a shiver down his spine, a mix of fear and determination.

The chase led deeper into Thalos’ underbelly—a maze where shadows ruled supreme—and Theigon knew he couldn’t afford to lose them now. However, as Theigon began to catch up to the assassin, another hooded figure stepped from the shadows and hurled something towards him. Theigon, without hesitation, drew a short blade sheathed by his left rib, slashing at the ball. It popped, sending powder everywhere, covering the street in its violet hue. Theigon stumbled through it before falling to one knee. Glancing up, he saw the two figures look back at him before his eyes clouded and darkness ensnared his senses…

<p style="text-align:center;">◇─◇────◆─◈─◆────◇─◇</p>

A sting of cold air penetrated his lungs as he took a deep breath, shuddering at the bite and the metallic taste of iron. Each breath felt pained like sandpaper coated his lungs. His head ringing from a lack of water. Thurst knawed at his chest cripplingly so. The desire to through up onto the cold stone floor. Every part of him felt weak.

Theigon gently lifted his head, wincing as the light burned his eyes, which struggled to adjust. whilst most other senses burned or failed him. His hearing, remained unaffected. Two men spoke plainly across from him. He listened intently.

“I’ve notified Lord Halford,” one said begrudgingly. “Good thing we got to him first”.

Oh, thank God, Theigon thought. Halford would be the perfect person to talk to. Halford seemed like a nice man—considerate and understanding. And having worked for him for over three years now it feels as though hed be the best person to listen to what he saw.

Then another thought stirred in his mind… what if these were the assassins, maybe Halford had orchestrated this? “FUCK! Am I in danger?”…

“What the fuck does Halford want with a lowlife like him? Perhaps he wants to beat him for answers,” sneered the second, a clear hiss in his words.

“By Helios, man, didn’t you hear a word I said?” The sound of clinking armour could be heard as he moved across the room. “Lord Halford hired us to take care of some people for him, likely hood is he’ll just turn the scrawny trash over to the guards” There was a long pause. 

Theigon grimaced as a hand suddenly grabbed his hair and yanked his head back to look up at one of the men.

“Oh, look, he’s awake,” Theigon’s head hammered with a throbbing pain as nausea set in. He tried to speak to his captors, but Theigon’s mouth felt dry like his innards were coated in cinnamon powder or dust. Searing pain coursed up his neck as bile rose to burn him from the inside.

“Fuck me!” he thought. “That powder bomb must have been some powerful toxin.”

As he struggled to speak, Theigon's mind raced with questions. What did Lord Halford want with him? And who were these men? The one who seemed to know Halford spoke with a tone of respect, but the other's malice was palpable. Theigon's thoughts were clouded by pain and confusion, but he knew he had to stay alert if he was going to survive this.

Theigon's gaze met the man holding his hair, and for a moment, their eyes locked. Theigon saw a glimmer of recognition there, but it was quickly replaced by indifference. The man released his grip, letting Theigon's head fall back onto the cold stone floor.

“Get him up,” the first man ordered, his voice firm but not unkind. “Lord Halford is waiting.”

Theigon was dragged to his feet, his legs wobbly beneath him. As he stumbled forward, he caught glimpses of his surroundings—a dimly lit cellar with stone walls and a low ceiling. The air was damp and musty, filled with the scent of mould and decay.

With each step, Theigon's senses began to return, and he realized that he was in grave danger. He needed to think clearly and act quickly if he was going to escape alive. As he moved through the space, he noticed the damp smell of mud and sodden dirt. “Underground,” he thought to himself. “Perhaps under the old barracks?” It was at this time he noticed the armour on the man to his left. It was plain light armor, mostly leather with some plating over key places such as the chest and head. What was interesting was the insignia located on the left of the breastplate—a sword with a dragon curled up around its blade, its head cresting above the hilt in a proud stance.

The other man on the right bore the same insignia, albeit on leather armour and no helmet. He was a rung below the other man, and his look of constant disdain would confirm that.

They reached another room, this one much the same as the one he had woken up in. However, two chairs and a table were placed at its centre. Upon the table, a large jug of presumably water was placed, and a plate of food—simple bread and what looked like ham.

Theigon was thrust into one of the chairs as the door across the room opened to reveal a tall, dark figure. His clothes fitted tight upon his torso, with a gold bracer high on his right arm and a red cloak draped over him as he loomed into the room.

“Leave us,” he said, waving his hand. The two men nodded and left the room, closing the door behind them.

Lord Halford was a tall, dark-skinned man with a soft face. His hazel eyes, flecked with green—a testament to his magical prowess—held a warmth that seemed almost out of place in the cold, damp surroundings. His hair was black and swept back, revealing a face that was both strong and gentle. His gaze fluttered across Theigon as though inspecting for damage, but there was a lingering quality to it, a softness that hinted at deeper emotions.

“Drink,” he then said sharply, handing Theigon the jug without bothering to pour it into a glass. Theigon grasped the jug and began to empty it, almost breathing it in. After setting it aside, Halford’s hand clasped his face, lifting it to meet his gaze. He looked intently into Theigon’s eyes as if delving into the soul. For a moment, they just stared at each other, the tension between them palpable. Halford took a step back, dropping his hand, but his eyes lingered.

“Good, you don’t seem to be dying,” he dared a faint smile before squaring his shoulders and dropping the smile to a stern look. “I need to know, did you kill him?”

Theigon looked on in silence, “Killed who?”

“The king,” Halford looked with piercing eyes, all sense of care or kindness stripped from his features, though his voice betrayed a hint of concern.

“No,” Theigon said softly, “but I chased the one who did. I ran after him through Gravely Avenue towards the slums, but I lost them near Elara’s Plaza by the Wispy Way tavern.”

Halford’s posture loosened, and he closed his eyes as if allowing himself to wallow in what was said. “Do you have any witnesses of this?” Halford prodded. “If not, then I’d suggest staying low for a while. Eridan has put out a bounty on a man of your description. I’ll do what I can to brush things over, but I can’t promise anything.” His eyes opened again, locking onto Theigon’s for a split second before turning towards the door. “I’ll ask them to escort you to your place.”

As Halford turned to leave, Theigon spoke up, his voice firm despite the lingering pain. “Lord Halford, what’s going on? Who is behind the king’s assassination? And what does Lord Eridan want with me?”

Halford paused, his back still to Theigon. For a moment, there was silence. Then, without turning, he said, “Those are questions for another time, Theigon. As for Eridan, you're suspect number one. For now, just be careful. The streets are not safe for you.”

With that, he exited the room, leaving Theigon to ponder the mysteries that had just unfolded.

<p style="text-align:center;">◇─◇────◆─◈─◆────◇─◇</p>

The next day came all too quickly, by the time he'd gotten home it had been far into the night. He had watched the moons from the window for a while before bed, mulling over the events of the day. Mostly trying to piece together parts of a puzzle that didn’t quite match. Assassins with unnatural speed, the convenience of those men working for Halford, Eridan's bounty, and... Halford.

Theigon thought of the caring gaze of his former client—a man who was in constant need of the inside and outs of his friends and foes. A man who had hired him three years ago to be his scout, his secret keeper, his spy. It had only been the last eight months that he'd ever had the chance to meet Halford in person. Most of the time their talks were through missives. “Always nice to put a face to the name,” Theigon smiled to himself, remembering the first time they met.

He looked out of the window as the new dawn splayed golden rays across the rooftops.

“Laying low...” he muttered to himself as he adorned his light armour, cloak, and daggers. His equipment had been modified to sport six daggers—two on either side of his ribs for easy access, with one on each leg in the slit he made between the boots and his trousers. A belt of various small bottles of tinctures and potions for quick use and some easy-access utility tools was fastened around his waist. A small pouch sat on his lower back under the cloak, holding any other small items that weren't needed at much speed. His hair was a dark brown, almost black, and his brown eyes matched with a similar shade. A scar just above his left eyebrow could be tucked under some locks of hair. Most wouldn't look twice at Theigon. His usual looks and nondescript features certainly helped him pass most people unnoticed.

Theigon stepped out of his room into the hallway of the apartment and locked the door with his key, ensuring his wards were holding. He wasn't a wizard or sorcerer, but Halford was. Another smile edged across his face before he turned to start down the hall.

As he walked, Theigon couldn't help but think about his past missions for Halford. There had been times when he'd been asked to gather information from the shadows, to watch and wait without being seen. It was a skill he'd honed well, but it also left him with a sense of detachment, as if he was always on the outside looking in.

Theigon stopped dead in his tracks as a large, hulking figure walked towards him, his eyes fixed on him as he made his way towards Theigon. The man came within five feet of Theigon before stopping. Crossing his arms, Theigon clasped two daggers sheathed by his ribs.

“Are you Theigon?” the man spoke with power and authority but lowered his voice so no one could hear.

“Who's asking?” Theigon replied, ready to stab two daggers into the massive man. He couldn't take him down now, not with how powerful he looked and how he was at least a foot and a half taller than Theigon. The man smiled, not a grimace or grin, but also not soft or endearing. An acknowledgement. He pulled out a rolled-up paper and offered it to him. Theigon took the paper in one hand, holding the still-sheathed dagger in the other, and unfurled it. It was a wanted poster marked as 10,000 gold with a roughly drawn face resembling his own.

The man chuffed and walked past, placing a hand gently on Theigon's shoulder, tapping lightly before unlocking a door to step inside.

“You're not going to claim it?” Theigon asked, desperately trying to hold his nerve and level his voice.

“I only pick fights I can win,” the door shut behind him. Theigon's heart pounded in his chest as confusion hit him. “That guy could have crushed me,” he thought as he made his way down the steps to the street below.

As he walked, Theigon couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. The city seemed quieter than usual, the streets less crowded. It was as if everyone was waiting for something to happen, for the next move in a game that Theigon didn't fully understand.

He decided to visit some of his old contacts, hoping to gather more information about the bounty and Eridan's motives. But as he navigated the winding streets, he couldn't help but wonder what Halford's role was in all this. Was he truly just a concerned noble, or was there more to it?

Theigon's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of hammers ringing out from a nearby blacksmith. He paused, watching as the smith worked, his muscles flexing with each strike. It was a reminder that even amid intrigue and danger, life went on. People worked, lived, and loved, oblivious to the shadows that moved unseen.

But for Theigon, there was no ignoring the shadows. Not now, not when his life depended on understanding them.
