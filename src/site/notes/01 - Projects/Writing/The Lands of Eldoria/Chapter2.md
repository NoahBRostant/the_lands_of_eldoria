# Chapter Two - 

---

The next day came all too quickly, by the time he'd gotten home it had been far into the night. He had watched the moons from the window for a while before bed, mulling over the events of the day. Mostly trying to piece together parts of a puzzle that didn’t quite match. Assassins with unnatural speed, the convenience of those men working for Halford, Eridan's bounty, and... Halford.

Theigon thought of the caring gaze of his former client—a man who was in constant need of the inside and outs of his friends and foes. A man who had hired him three years ago to be his scout, his secret keeper, his spy. It had only been the last eight months that he'd ever had the chance to meet Halford in person. Most of the time their talks were through missives. “Always nice to put a face to the name,” Theigon smiled to himself, remembering the first time they met.

He looked out of the window as the new dawn splayed golden rays across the rooftops.

“Laying low...” he muttered to himself as he adorned his light armour, cloak, and daggers. His equipment had been modified to sport six daggers—two on either side of his ribs for easy access, with one on each leg in the slit he made between the boots and his trousers. A belt of various small bottles of tinctures and potions for quick use and some easy-access utility tools was fastened around his waist. A small pouch sat on his lower back under the cloak, holding any other small items that weren't needed at much speed. His hair was a dark brown, almost black, and his brown eyes matched with a similar shade. A scar just above his left eyebrow could be tucked under some locks of hair. Most wouldn't look twice at Theigon. His usual looks and nondescript features certainly helped him pass most people unnoticed.

Theigon stepped out of his room into the hallway of the apartment and locked the door with his key, ensuring his wards were holding. He wasn't a wizard or sorcerer, but Halford was. Another smile edged across his face before he turned to start down the hall.

As he walked, Theigon couldn't help but think about his past missions for Halford. There had been times when he'd been asked to gather information from the shadows, to watch and wait without being seen. It was a skill he'd honed well, but it also left him with a sense of detachment, as if he was always on the outside looking in.

Theigon stopped dead in his tracks as a large, hulking figure walked towards him, his eyes fixed on him as he made his way towards Theigon. The man came within five feet of Theigon before stopping. Crossing his arms, Theigon clasped two daggers sheathed by his ribs.

“Are you Theigon?” the man spoke with power and authority but lowered his voice so no one could hear.

“Who's asking?” Theigon replied, ready to stab two daggers into the massive man. He couldn't take him down now, not with how powerful he looked and how he was at least a foot and a half taller than Theigon. The man smiled, not a grimace or grin, but also not soft or endearing. An acknowledgement. He pulled out a rolled-up paper and offered it to him. Theigon took the paper in one hand, holding the still-sheathed dagger in the other, and unfurled it. It was a wanted poster marked as 10,000 gold with a roughly drawn face resembling his own.

The man chuffed and walked past, placing a hand gently on Theigon's shoulder, tapping lightly before unlocking a door to step inside.

“You're not going to claim it?” Theigon asked, desperately trying to hold his nerve and level his voice.

“I only pick fights I can win,” the door shut behind him. Theigon's heart pounded in his chest as confusion hit him. “That guy could have crushed me,” he thought as he made his way down the steps to the street below.

As he walked, Theigon couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. The city seemed quieter than usual, the streets less crowded. It was as if everyone was waiting for something to happen, for the next move in a game that Theigon didn't fully understand.

He decided to visit some of his old contacts, hoping to gather more information about the bounty and Eridan's motives. But as he navigated the winding streets, he couldn't help but wonder what Halford's role was in all this. Was he truly just a concerned noble, or was there more to it?

Theigon's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of hammers ringing out from a nearby blacksmith. He paused, watching as the smith worked, his muscles flexing with each strike. It was a reminder that even amid intrigue and danger, life went on. People worked, lived, and loved, oblivious to the shadows that moved unseen.

But for Theigon, there was no ignoring the shadows. Not now, not when his life depended on understanding them.
