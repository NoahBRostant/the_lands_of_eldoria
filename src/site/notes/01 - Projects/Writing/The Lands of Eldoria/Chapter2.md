# Chapter Two - The Dawn of Unity

---

Elara stood atop the grand balcony of the royal palace, her ivory hair catching the morning light as it cascaded down her shoulders. Below her stretched Thalos, the heart of the newly unified Korvus Confederacy, a city that bore the scars of war yet pulsed with the promise of peace. The treaty had been signed mere hours ago, and silence reigned for the first time in decades—not the silence of fear, but of anticipation. The bustling streets below were still as if the city held its breath.

Beside her stood Mortanir Corvanos, his imposing figure cloaked in crimson and gold. He had been her most trusted ally throughout the war, a man whose cunning and ruthlessness had turned tides in battles that seemed unwinnable. His Brotherhood had been instrumental in ending the conflict, their precision and efficiency unmatched. Elara glanced at him briefly, her gaze softening as she considered his role in forging this fragile peace.

“They will call this day a triumph,” Mortanir said, his voice deep and steady. “But triumphs are fleeting. The wounds of war do not heal overnight.”

Elara nodded, her eyes fixed on the city below. “That is why we must act swiftly. The council will be our cornerstone—representing unity among the factions that once tore this land apart. Nine voices to guide Korvus forward: seven for the houses that fought for their provinces, one for the crown, and one for your Brotherhood.”

Mortanir’s lips curved into a faint smile. “A bold move, granting my Brotherhood a seat among nobles.”

“It is no less than you deserve,” Elara replied firmly. “Without your efforts, this treaty would have been impossible.”

Her gaze swept across Thalos—the repurposed barracks now bustling with merchants, the charred remnants of old fortifications standing as silent reminders of past battles. She thought of each house that had signed their name to the treaty: Valtor’s mountain lords, Calanthor’s sea captains, Arinthal’s cavalry masters… each faction had fought tooth and nail for dominance. And now they would sit together under one banner.

“The council must understand,” Elara continued, “that unity requires sacrifice. New laws will be enacted to ensure fairness—trade regulations to prevent monopolies and land reforms to aid those displaced by war. But there will be resistance.”

Mortanir’s gaze darkened slightly as he spoke. “Resistance often breeds rebellion. And rebellion… well, you know how quickly it can spread.”

Elara turned to face him fully now, her expression resolute. “That is why I need you to remain vigilant. Your Brotherhood will be our shield against those who seek to unravel what we have built.”

Mortanir inclined his head slightly in acknowledgement but said nothing more.

As Elara looked out once more over Thalos, she felt a mixture of pride and unease settle in her chest. The treaty was signed, and the council was formed, yet peace felt like a fragile thread stretched taut between opposing forces. She thought of Queen Elara’s legacy—how history might remember her as either a unifier or a tyrant.

And then she thought of Mortanir—her trusted advisor and emissary—and wondered if she had placed too much faith in a man whose ambitions might one day eclipse her own.
