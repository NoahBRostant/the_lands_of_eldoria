# Authors Note

---

I want to extend my deepest gratitude to you for choosing to immerse yourself in the world of _The Lands of Eldoria and the Blessed Isles: Theigon_. It is a true honor to share this story with you, and I hope that it will transport you to realms both captivating and thought-provoking.

However, I must also take a moment to acknowledge that this book contains mature themes and content that may not be suitable for all readers. Please be aware that you will encounter scenes of graphic torture, humiliation, and depravity, as well as scenes of a sexual nature. Additionally, the narrative includes significant violence, which may be disturbing for some.

These elements are integral to the story, reflecting the darker aspects of human nature and the complexities of the world in which Theigon navigates. If you are sensitive to such content, I encourage you to proceed with caution.

Thank you again for your interest in this tale, and I hope that it will resonate with you on a profound level.

May Aethon's light guide you, Vesper's wisdom direct you, and Niamh's shadows protect you. Yet, remember, history favors the victor, not the righteous. The gods' favor is fleeting, and time's judgment is harsh.
